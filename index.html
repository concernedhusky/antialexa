    <h1>Northeastern's Alexa Program is a nonconsensual violation of student privacy, and must be discontinued immediately.</h1>

          <li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/24/amazon-alexa-recorded-conversation">Amazon Alexas listen to you 24/7, even when you do not activate them by saying "Alexa"</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/07/amazon-echo-murder/">This data is stored permanently by Amazon, and has been used in court as evidence against unwittingly surveilled defendants.</a> Obviously, in the linked case, it's great that a guilty person was caught and jailed. But it is clearly concerning that Alexas can serve as a permanent wiretap, circumventing a warrant.</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.the-ambient.com/features/how-amazon-google-apple-use-smart-speaker-data-338">These Alexas are being used to help Amazon market to college students better by listening to your conversations.</a> They are using advanced data science to manipulate you.</li>
          <li><a href="https://huntnewsnu.com/52821/campus/activist-groups-advocate-to-fund-accredit-uhcs/">These Alexas were a wasteful misuse of your tuition dollars, as the University prioritizes serving its corporate donors over funding much-needed services such as UHCS that continually go underfunded.</a></li>

    <h3>If you care at all for your own privacy, your own independence against advanced corporate manipulation, or the university's duty to serve students over corporations, <a href="https://www.change.org/p/northeastern-university-northeastern-must-discontinue-the-husky-helper-program?recruiter=930610192&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=copylink&utm_campaign=share_petition">sign here</a> to voice your opposition to Northeastern's Alexa initiative.</p>
    <h3>Even if you don't care about being spied on, if you have "nothing to hide", know that thousands of your peers do - consider their wishes for privacy.</p>
